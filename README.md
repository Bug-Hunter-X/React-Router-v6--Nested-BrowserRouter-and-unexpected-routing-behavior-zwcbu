# React Router v6: Nested BrowserRouter and Unexpected Routing Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue in React Router v6 related to nested `BrowserRouter` components and unexpected routing behavior.  The issue arises when `BrowserRouter` is nested within another router, leading to problems with route matching and navigation.

## Problem

The main problem lies in the interaction between nested routers. Using `BrowserRouter` inside another router (like `MemoryRouter` in testing scenarios) can cause conflicts and prevent routes from rendering correctly.

This example shows an `App.js` file with a nested `BrowserRouter`.  Routes might not render as expected or navigation might fail. Using the `element` prop instead of `component` in Route can also lead to unexpected issues if not managed correctly.

## Solution

The solution involves restructuring the routing to avoid nested `BrowserRouter` instances. Using a single `BrowserRouter` at the root of your application is usually sufficient.  Also, proper understanding of the element prop in Route helps avoid other potential issues. The solution also provides clear examples of how to handle nested routes properly without issues.

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This code uses `BrowserRouter` which can cause issues if nested within another router like `MemoryRouter`.  The `Routes` and `Route` components need to have a single root route.  The use of `element` prop instead of `component` can lead to unexpected behaviour if not handled correctly. The nesting structure of the routes matters; incorrectly nested routes can lead to unexpected routing behaviour.
